# flasklabsCo
This is ecommerce website with session based shopping cart.
Note:This is not production ready project and it is not suitable for production environment. Project contains raw code snippets and not the greatest coding practices. It was made this way intentionally. For eduactional purposes only.

# About the project
This is eCommerce website with user authentication. It contains basic logic for cart and login. I kept SQLite db to keep this project as simple as possible.
To use it without any troubles you need to login since I haven't really worked on authorization. You can create products, add it to cart and order it. You can see list of orders in pseudo admin page.

# About coding practices used in this project
This project was made only as showcase of Flask. I wouldn't use such code in production and I also wouldn't use Flask for regular ecommerce projects but it is still possible to use Flask in big commercial projects and this project proves it.
