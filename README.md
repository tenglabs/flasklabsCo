# About the project
This eCommerce website with user authentication. It contains basic logic for cart and login. I kept SQLite db to keep this project as simple as possible.
To use it without any troubles you need to login since I haven't really worked on authorization. You can Add products, add it to cart and order it. You can watch list of orders in pseudo admin page.

# About coding practices used in this project
This project was made only as showcase of Flask. I wouldn't use such code in production and I also wouldn't use Flask for ecommerce projects but it is still possible to use Flask in big commercial projects and this project proves it.
